# phosphosRNAseq_Manuscript_Analysis
5-3-2019: Due to a recent error I made creating this repo for public consumption, some of the cleaned and simplified analysis code was lost and needs to be regenerated. I will work on getting the updates posted soon. 

R code to reproduce analysis for phospho-RNAseq manuscript: http://emboj.embopress.org/content/early/2019/04/30/embj.2019101695.print

This code contains the analysis and figure/table generation downstream of the mapping/analysis pipeline. For information on the mapping pipeline steps, please see the manuscript.
